# TicTacToe

Tic Tac Toe is my first public project on GitHub. I used HTML, JavaScript and CSS to create a simple Tic Tac Toe-computer.

Player 1 begins by using the crosses. [X]

Player 2 continues by using the circles. [O]

The programm realizes wins, defeats and draws.

You can change usernames by using the settings-menu. AI doesn't exist yet, but it will come in the next updates. Please don't write something into the console, because there could be problems if you do!

Apart from that, have fun by playing Tic Tac Toe!
